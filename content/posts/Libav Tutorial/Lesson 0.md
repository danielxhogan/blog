## Welcome to the Libav Tutorial!

This tutorial will show you how to use the Libav library in C to process video
files. It doesn't assume any prior knowledge of the library but it does assume
anyone following this tutorial is familiar with FFmpeg, C, general video/audio
concepts, and general programming concepts.

The first section of this tutorial will be all about remuxing. It will go
through examples that show how to perform various operations on video files
without encoding or decoding such as reformatting, copying and editing metadata,
adding chapters, adding subtitles, combining streams from multiple input files,
and seperating streams into multiple ouput files.

The second section will be about transcoding, the third section will be about
filtering, the fourth section will be about video playback, the fifth section
will be about video/audio capture, and the sixth section will be about
video streaming.
